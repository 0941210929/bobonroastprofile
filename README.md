> A place to record and keep track of your coffee roast profiles in real-time.

This is the codebase for [Bobon Profiles](https://roast.bobon.coffee)

## Prerequisite

Bobon Profiles is a React - Redux app built on top of Firebase backend.

If you are planning to develop a separate project from this (using a different database), a new Firebase project is required. After that, update your own FIREBASE configurations of in `src/constants.js`

## Development


```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

After that, access the site at https://localhost:8080 (IMPORTANT: HTTPS, not HTTP - so we can use Firebase redirect authentication with Facebook and Google from the development site)
